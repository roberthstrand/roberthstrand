## Hello! 👨‍💻

As my username might have given away, my name is Roberth. I'm an alright guy (biased opinion) that work making computers beep. Actually, scratch that... Beeping computers are usually a bad sign.

I work at [@AmestoFortytwo](https://github.com/amestofortytwo), building new and exciting cloud-native solutions.

I am a Microsoft Azure MVP, and a HashiCorp Ambassador.
