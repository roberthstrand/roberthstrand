## Hello! üë®‚Äçüíª

As my username might have given away, my name is Roberth. I'm an alright guy (biased opinion) that work making computers beep. Actually, scratch that... Beeping computers are usually a bad sign.

I work as Head of Platform Engineering for [@Crayon](https://github.com/crayon), bringing DevOps and Cloud Native methods to the organization. Looking forward to being able to share more of this journey soon. In my spare time, I work a bunch with different groups in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

I am a Microsoft Azure MVP, and a HashiCorp Ambassador.
