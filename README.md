## Hello! üë®‚Äçüíª

As my username might have given away, my name is Roberth. I'm an alright guy (biased opinion) that work making computers beep. Actually, scratch that... Beeping computers are usually a bad sign.

I work at Amesto Fortytwo, building new and exciting platform engineering services. You can check us out at [amestofortytwo.com](https://amestofortytwo.com) or here on [GitHub](https://github.com/amestofortytwo).

I am a Microsoft Azure MVP, and a HashiCorp Ambassador. If you need anyone to help out at a project, speak at a conference or user group, or a mentor, reach out to me on LinkedIn or my [email](mailto:roberth.strand+ghcontact@amesto.no).
