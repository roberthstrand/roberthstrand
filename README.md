             Need a speaker or something for your project? Everything outside of work, I do for free, 
             so just slip me a note somewhere. I am also hosting meetups for the Norwegian PowerShell User Group,
             upping the Norwegian shell-game. If you have a topic you want to talk about, reach out and we will 
             set of an evening. You can find me on Twitter (twitter.com/roberthtweets), 
             Sessionize (sessionize.com/roberth-strand) and untappd (untappd.com/user/RoberthDrinks)
